This is an In-Class Project I designed to help teach conditional statements using Street Fighter characters.

For my class I used three characters: Ryu, Guile, and Chun-Li. Each character has animations, a special move, and a sound effect.

This project can be used to teach conditional statements, basic state machines, or utilizing Resources inside of a Visual Basic project.
